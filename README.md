### Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multilayered neural networks, called deep neural networks, to simulate the complex decision-making power of the human brain.
### Neural Networks: Deep learning models use artificial neural networks (ANNs), which consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons).
### Layers of Processing: These networks typically have three types of layers:
 ### Input Layer: Takes raw data (e.g., images, text, numbers).
###  Hidden Layers: Extracts and learns features automatically.
 ### Output Layer: Produces the final prediction.
### Backpropagation & Optimization: The network adjusts weights using backpropagation and optimization techniques like gradient descent to minimize error.
### Activation Functions: Non-linear functions (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax) help the network learn complex relationships.
### A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a special type of deep learning model that is designed for image processing and computer vision tasks. 
### A CNN has three main layers:

### Convolutional Layer üåÄ

### This layer scans the image piece by piece using small filters (kernels).
### It extracts important features like edges, corners, and textures.
### Example: If you show a CNN a cat picture, the first layers might detect edges, and deeper layers might recognize eyes, ears, and whiskers.

### Pooling Layer üîç (Downsampling)
### This layer reduces the size of the image, keeping only the most important information.
### It helps make the model faster and prevents overfitting.
### Example: If a cat‚Äôs eye is detected in one part of the image, it doesn‚Äôt need to check every single pixel again.

### Fully Connected Layer üéØ
### After extracting features, the CNN connects everything into a standard neural network.
### It classifies the image (e.g., "cat" or "dog").
