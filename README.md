### Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multilayered neural networks, called deep neural networks, to simulate the complex decision-making power of the human brain.
### Neural Networks: Deep learning models use artificial neural networks (ANNs), which consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons).
Layers of Processing: These networks typically have three types of layers:
  Input Layer: Takes raw data (e.g., images, text, numbers).
  Hidden Layers: Extracts and learns features automatically.
  Output Layer: Produces the final prediction.
Backpropagation & Optimization: The network adjusts weights using backpropagation and optimization techniques like gradient descent to minimize error.
Activation Functions: Non-linear functions (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax) help the network learn complex relationships.
